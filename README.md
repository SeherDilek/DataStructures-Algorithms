# Data structures and algorithms (C++)

This repository is created by following the [C++ Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.perlego.com/book/695266/c-data-structures-and-algorithms-pdf).

### Chapter01 - Learning data structures and algorithms in C++
Create run and build a simple C++ program.

### Chapter02 - Storing data in lists and linked lists
* Build a list data structure using the array data type, implement the concept of node siand node chaining.
* Build SinglyLinkedList and DoublyLinkedList using node chaining.
* Apply the Standard Template Library to implement the list and linked
list

### Chapter03 - Constructing stacks and queues
* Build a Stack abstract data type (ADT) and then fetch, push, and pop elements in this ADT
* Build a Queue ADT and then fetch, enque, and deque elements in this ADT
* Build a Dequeue ADT and then fetch, enque, and deque elements in this ADT

### Chapter04 - Arranging data elements using sorting algorithm
Implement sorting algorithms:

* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Counting sort
* Radix sort

### Chapter05 - Finding out an Element using searching algorithms
Implement searching algorithms:
  * Linear search
  * Binary search
  * Ternary search
  * Interpolation search
  * Jump search
  * Exponential search
  * Sublist search

### Chapter06 - Dealing with string data type
* Write functions to:
  * find out whether a string is an anagram or palindrome
  * create a sequence of binary digits as binary string
  * generate a subsequence of a string
  * search a pattern in a string

### Chapter07 - Building a hierarchical tree structure
* Implement the tree data structure
* Implement the binary search tree
* Balance the binary search tree
* Implement the priority queue using a binary heap


### Chapter08 - Associating a Value and Key in a hash table
* Write functions to prevent a collision in a hash table:
  * Using a separate chaining technique to handle a collision
  * Using an open addressing technique to handle a collision

### Chapter09 - Implementation of algorithms in real life
Implement:
  * Greedy algorithms
  * Divide and conquer algorithms
  * Dynamic programming
  * Brute-force algorithms
  * Randomized algorithms
  * Backtracking algortihms
